        Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interaction among rational decision-makers.
        It has applications in all fields of social science, as well as in logic, systems science and computer
        science. Originally, it addressed zero-sum games, in which each participant's gains or losses are exactly
        balanced by those of the other participants. Today, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral
        relations, and is now an umbrella term for the science of logical decision making in humans, animals, and computers.

        Modern game theory began with the idea of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person zero-sum games and its proof
        by John von Neumann. Von Neumann's original proof used the Brouwer fixed-point theorem on continuous mappings
        into compact convex sets, which became a standard method in game theory and mathematical economics. His paper
        was followed by the 1944 book Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, co-written with Oskar Morgenstern, which
        considered cooperative games of several players. The second edition of this book provided an axiomatic theory
        of expected utility, which allowed mathematical statisticians and economists to treat decision-making under
        uncertainty.
