        Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interaction among rational decision-makers.
        It has applications in all fields of social science, as well as in logic, systems science and computer
        science. Originally, it addressed zero-sum games, in which each participant's gains or losses are exactly
        balanced by those of the other participants. Today, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral
        relations, and is now an umbrella term for the science of logical decision making in humans, animals, and computers.

        Modern game theory began with the idea of mixed-strategy equilibria in two-person zero-sum games and its proof
        by John von Neumann. Von Neumann's original proof used the Brouwer fixed-point theorem on continuous mappings
        into compact convex sets, which became a standard method in game theory and mathematical economics. His paper
        was followed by the 1944 book Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, co-written with Oskar Morgenstern, which
        considered cooperative games of several players. The second edition of this book provided an axiomatic theory
        of expected utility, which allowed mathematical statisticians and economists to treat decision-making under
        uncertainty.

        Game theory was developed extensively in the 1950s by many scholars. It was explicitly applied to biology in the 1970s,
        although similar developments go back at least as far as the 1930s. Game theory has been widely recognized as an
        important tool in many fields. As of 2014, with the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences going to game theorist Jean
        Tirole, eleven game theorists have won the economics Nobel Prize. John Maynard Smith was awarded the Crafoord Prize for
        his application of game theory to biology.

        The primary use of game theory is to describe and model how human populations behave.
        Some scholars believe that by finding the equilibria of games they can predict how actual
        human populations will behave when confronted with situations analogous to the game being
        studied. This particular view of game theory has been criticized. It is argued that the
        assumptions made by game theorists are often violated when applied to real-world situations.
        Game theorists usually assume players act rationally, but in practice human behavior often
        deviates from this model. Game theorists respond by comparing their assumptions to those used
        in physics.
